Answer Number 1.
Working of a webpage is a combination of Working of frontend and backend through which a user can enter data and access or use our website.Front-end development focuses on the user-facing side of a website. Front-end developers ensure that visitors can easily interact with and navigate sites by using programming languages, design skills, and other tools.Back-end developers focus on the server side of websites. They use technical skills to perform the behind-the scenes work that creates a website's structure and overall functionality, allowing a site'sfront end to exist.
so for an example user tries to interact with server say www.google.com it will send as a request to the server this request will be send to server this is the front and part and then the server whatever the Google or research engine I will try to interact with the database and whatever searching searching single happened that will be back and part and this whole process the front and back and the call database whatever it is the development.

Answer Number 2.
Tags are the building blocks of HTML that describe the structure and content of a web page. They are the “Markup” part of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).HTML syntax uses the angle brackets (”<” and ”>”) to hold the name of an HTML element. Elements usually have an opening tag and a closing tag, and give information about the content they contain. The difference between the two is that the closing tag has a forward slash.
Let's look at some specific examples of HTML tags.
The <p> tag stands for paragraph, which is the most common tag used to create lines of text inside an HTML document.
The <a> tag stands for anchor, which is the most common tag used for hyper link or we can se referal links.
similarly there are image tag <img> ,video tag ,head line tags etc.

Answer Number 3.
First things first, DOM stands for “Document Object Model”. The DOM in simple words represents the UI of your application. Everytime there is a change in the state of your application UI, the DOM gets updated to represent that change. Now the catch is frequently manipulating the DOM affects performance, making it slow.
The DOM is represented as a tree data structure. Because of that, the changes and updates to the DOM are fast. But after the change, the updated element and it’s children have to be re-rendered to update the application UI. The re-rendering or re-painting of the UI is what makes it slow. Therefore, the more UI components you have, the more expensive the DOM updates could be, since they would need to be re-rendered for every DOM update.
That’s where the concept of virtual DOM comes in and performs significantly better than the real DOM. The virtual DOM is only a virtual representation of the DOM. Everytime the state of our application changes, the virtual DOM gets updated instead of the real DOM.

Answer Number 4.
Differences between SQL and NoSQL
--> SQL pronounced as “S-Q-L” or as “See-Quel” is primarily called RDBMS or Relational Databases, whereas NoSQL is a Non-relational or Distributed Database.
--> Comparing SQL vs NoSQL databases, SQL databases are table-based databases, whereas NoSQL databases can be document-based, key-value pairs, and graph databases.
--> SQL databases are vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
--> SQL databases have a predefined schema, whereas NoSQL databases use a dynamic schema for unstructured data.
--> Comparing NoSQL vs SQL performance, SQL requires specialized DB hardware for better performance while NoSQL uses commodity hardware.

Answer Number 5.
The DBMS manages the data; the database engine allows data to be accessed, locked and modified; and the database schema defines the database's logical structure.
One Of The Technology is...
NewSQL DBMS --> 
              Modern relational systems that use SQL, NewSQL database systems offer the same scalable performance as NoSQL systems. But NewSQL systems also provide ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability) support for data consistency. A NewSQL DBMS is engineered as a relational, SQL database system with a distributed, fault-tolerant architecture. Other typical features of NewSQL system offerings include in-memory capability and clustered database services with the ability to be deployed in the cloud. Many NewSQL DBMS packages have fewer features and components and a smaller footprint than legacy relational offerings, making them easier to support and understand. Some vendors now eschew the NewSQL label and describe their technologies as distributed SQL databases. CockroachDB, Google Cloud Spanner, NuoDB, Volt Active Data and YugabyteDB are examples of database systems in this category.
